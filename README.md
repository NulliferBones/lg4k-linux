# Live Gamer 4K Linux driver

WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF SOMEONE COULD FIX THIS BETTER THAN I CAN.
there are crashing problems I can not solve

CURRENTLY NOT WORKING ON NEW KERNELS AT ALL


Based on the Linux driver for the [CL511HN](https://www.avermedia.com/professional/product/cl511hn/overview)
which can be downloaded here: [Generic_Ubuntu_CL511HN_Drv_1.0.0031.zip](http://storage.avermedia.com/web_release_www/CL511HN/Generic_Ubuntu_CL511HN_Drv_1.0.0031.zip)

The CL511HN and GC573 (Live Gamer 4K) are very similar and their drivers are *mostly* interchangable. Though the firmware differences mean that some modes won't work on the LG4K.
